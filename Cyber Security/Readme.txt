These are Python scripts I have created for my Cyber Security class:

1) Coins.py 
	The goal of this script is to connect to a server, parse text, and make correct change to retrieve a flag

2) Game.py
	The goal of this script is to connect to a server, and add two numbers repeatedly to retrieve the flag
	
3) Robots.py
	The goal of this script was to retrieve an encoded message, and create a function to decode the string to
	retrieve the flag.
	
	I created the function to decode the message utilizing the encoding function given to me.
	
4) XOR.py
	I created a script to XOR the value 24 and 70 to each pair of bytes since the file meme7.png was encoded with XOR
