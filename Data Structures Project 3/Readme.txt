Project 3 for Data Structures
Implement a generic Queue class template and use it to implement breadth first search algorithm

The input is the direct flight information of various cities and the distance between each connected city
Then, the user inputs a source and destination city. Using this the program computes the shortest route
  between the two cities provided.
