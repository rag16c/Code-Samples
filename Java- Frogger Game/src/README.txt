 	This Frogger game was made by RILEY GARRISON for his Java project.

	All of the graphics you see was either drawn with paintComponent or 
 drawn by Microsoft Paint so I take all of the credit for the images.

	You move with WASD and WASD only

	High Scores are saved in the home directory in a Directory called
 FroggerFiles and in a file called HighScores.txt
	
				ISSUES THAT YOU MAY ENCOUNTER:
	If for any reason the game is not recognizing input, click on the Frame and press Tab. 
 This should fix the issue

	Also try not to move the frame as that seems to mess with a timer 
 in one of the classes. When not moved it functions properly. 

	Also, do not click on the menu when you are on the dying screen.
 Otherwise the frogger panel loses focus and you can only gain focus through pressing tab

		
		
				WHY THE GAME IS NOT RESIZABLE:
	The frame is not resizable because when it is resized the places of all the obstacles
 are shifted and messed up when resized back to normal.
